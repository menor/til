## Recommended web font stack
[Link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30136691)
For sans-serif, I recommend at most three items: a web font, system-ui, and sans-serif. No more. I would note that system-ui is not necessarily sans-serif, but in practice it almost always is, and ui-sans-serif (along with ui-serif, ui-monospace and ui-rounded) is only implemented by Safari yet.
For serif, I recommend at most three items, possibly including one named font: a web font, Georgia, and serif. See, serif is probably a narrower serif (something like Times New Roman), but Georgia a wider one—they’re fairly different in character, so that it can be worth including if you’re doing so deliberately.
For monospace, I recommend at most four: a web font, ui-monospace (I wouldn’t, but some macOS people prefer it), Consolas, and monospace. I think Consolas is worth keeping in until Firefox updates its Windows default (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=713680), because Courier New is that bad.
