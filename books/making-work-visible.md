# Making Work Visible Book

## Theory of Constraints
The Theory of Constraints is a way to identify the most important limitng factor (the constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal. And systematically improve that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.

## Workflow System
Use a workflow system that:
- makes work visible
- limits work in progress (WIP)
- measures and manages the flow of work
- prioritizes effectively
- makes adjustments based on learnings from feedback and metrics

## The 5 Thieves of Time
1 - Too much work in progress
2 - Unknown dependencies: Obstacles you didn't account for when planning
3 - Unplanned work:
    - Interruptions that stop you from finishing a task
4 - Conflicting Priorities:
    - Projects and tasks that conflict
    - exarcebated when you are uncertain about the most important thing to do
5 - Neglected work:
    - Partially completed work that sits idle in the bench

### 1 - Too much work in progress
- When we start new tasks without finishing an older task, our WIP goes up and thing takes longer to do.
- Cycle Time is the amount of elapsed time that a work item spends as work-in-progress
- WIP is a leading indicator of cycle time. The more items are worked on at the same time, the more doors open up that allow dependencies and interruptions to creep in.
- _Little's Law_: The average cycle time for finishing time is calculated as the ratio betwee WIP and throughput (`average cycletime = average WIP / average throughtput`)
- Signals that too much WIP is going on:
  - Context switching is common.
  - Customers wait for long periods of time.
  - Quality suffers.
  - Irritated Stuff (Interruptions thwart deep thinking).
- Kanban sets limits fow WIP items to avoid the system being overloaded.
- The right amount of WIP is what enables us to maintain a healthy amount of work.

### 2 - Unknown dependencies
