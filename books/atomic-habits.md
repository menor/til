# Atomic Habits

## The Power of Atomic Habits
- The aggregation of marginal gains is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
- Be more concerned with the process thatn with the results.
- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.
- In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.
### Forget about goals focus on systems instead
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.
- **Problem 1**: Winners and losers have the same goals.
- **Problem 2**: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. In order to improve for good you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- **Problem 3**: Goals restrict your happinness.
- **Problem 4**: Goals are at odds with long term progress. True long term thinking is based on building systems, not in achieving goals.

- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.

## How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identitiy is about what you believe.
- All levels of change are useful in their own way, the problem is the direction of change.
- True behaviour change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes a part of your identity.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuosly edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that) but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

## How to Build Better Habits with 4 Simple Steps
- Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention, moving tasks to the nonconscious mind whenever possible, to do them automatically.
- The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:
	- Cue
	- Craving
	- Response
	- Reward

- The thoughts, feelings and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
- Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.
- The four laws of behavior change:
	- Make it obvious
	- Make it attractive
	- Make it easy
	- Make it satisfying

## 1. Make it Obvious
- With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
- You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing and calling is effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.
- The habits scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
	- Make a list of your habits
	- Put a + sign next to it if the habit is positive, a - if negative and a = if neutral
	- Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identitiy are usually bad.

- To help you starting a new habit create an implementantion intention which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act (i.e. During the next week I will meditate for five minutes, first thing after waking up in the living room floor)

### Habit stacking
- The 1st law of behaviour change is "Make it Obvious"
- The two most common cues are time and location.
- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.
- The habit stacking formula is: "After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [NEW HABIT]
- One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your habits scorecard for this.

### Motivation is overrated, environment often matters more
- People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.
- When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.
- By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention towars a desired habit.
- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment, or better, have multiple cues for it.
- Our behavior is not defined by the objects in our environment but by our relationship to them.
- Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.
- When you can't manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one.
- A useful mantra is "One space, one use"
- Whenever possible avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you'll start mixing habits, and the easier ones will usually win.
- If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones.
- You can do the same with your digital spaces.

### The secret to self-control
- "Disciplined" people are better at structuring their lives in a way that makes them spend less time in tempting situations.
- The people with the best self-control are the ones who need to use it the least.
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce the exposure to the cue that causes it.
- Self-control is short term strategy, not a long term one.

## 2. Make it Attractive

### How to make a habit irresistible
- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming, is associated with higher levels of dopamine.
- The anticipation of a reward ("wanting") can often feel better than the attainment of it ("liking"),
- Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.
- Temptation bundling works by linking an action an action you want to do with an action you need to do (Watching movies while doing stationary bike)
- You can even combine temptaion bundling with habit stacking, with this formula:
	- After [current habit] I will [habit I need]
	- After [habit I need] I will [habit I want]
- We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
	- The close
		- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior
		- This is more powerful if you already have something in common with the group
	- The many
		- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.
	- The powerful
		- If a behavior can get us approval, respect and praise, we find it attractive.

### How find and fix the causes for your bad habits
- Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.
- Your habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires.
- The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.
- Hiighlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.

## 3. Make it Easy

### Walk slowly but never backward
