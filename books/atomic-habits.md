# Atomic Habits

## The Power of Atomic Habits
- The aggregation of marginal gains is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
- Be more concerned with the process thatn with the results.
- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.
- In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.
### Forget about goals focus on systems instead
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.
- **Problem 1**: Winners and losers have the same goals.
- **Problem 2**: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. In order to improve for good you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- **Problem 3**: Goals restrict your happinness.
- **Problem 4**: Goals are at odds with long term progress. True long term thinking is based on building systems, not in achieving goals.

- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.

## How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identitiy is about what you believe.
- All levels of change are useful in their own way, the problem is the direction of change.
- True behaviour change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes a part of your identity.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuosly edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that) but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

## How to Build Better Habits with 4 Simple Steps
- Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention, moving tasks to the nonconscious mind whenever possible, to do them automatically.
- The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:
	- Cue
	- Craving
	- Response
	- Reward

- The thoughts, feelings and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
- Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.
- The four laws of behavior change:
	- Make it obvious
	- Make it attractive
	- Make it easy
	- Make it satisfying

## 1. Make it Obvious
- With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
- You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing and calling is effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.
- The habits scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
	- Make a list of your habits
	- Put a + sign next to it if the habit is positive, a - if negative and a = if neutral
	- Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identitiy are usually bad.

- To help you starting a new habit create an implementantion intention which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act (i.e. During the next week I will meditate for five minutes, first thing after waking up in the living room floor)

### Habit stacking
- The 1st law of behaviour change is "Make it Obvious"
- The two most common cues are time and location.
- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.
- The habit stacking formula is: "After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [NEW HABIT]
- One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your habits scorecard for this.

### Motivation is overrated, environment often matters more
- People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.
- When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.
- By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention towars a desired habit.
- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment, or better, have multiple cues for it.
- Our behavior is not defined by the objects in our environment but by our relationship to them.
- Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.
- When you can't manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one.
- A useful mantra is "One space, one use"
- Whenever possible avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you'll start mixing habits, and the easier ones will usually win.
- If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones.
- You can do the same with your digital spaces.

### The secret to self-control
- "Disciplined" people are better at structuring their lives in a way that makes them spend less time in tempting situations.
- The people with the best self-control are the ones who need to use it the least.
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce the exposure to the cue that causes it.
- Self-control is short term strategy, not a long term one.

## 2. Make it Attractive

### How to make a habit irresistible
- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming, is associated with higher levels of dopamine.
- The anticipation of a reward ("wanting") can often feel better than the attainment of it ("liking"),
- Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.
- Temptation bundling works by linking an action an action you want to do with an action you need to do (Watching movies while doing stationary bike)
- You can even combine temptaion bundling with habit stacking, with this formula:
	- After [current habit] I will [habit I need]
	- After [habit I need] I will [habit I want]
- We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
	- The close
		- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior
		- This is more powerful if you already have something in common with the group
	- The many
		- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.
	- The powerful
		- If a behavior can get us approval, respect and praise, we find it attractive.

### How find and fix the causes for your bad habits
- Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.
- Your habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires.
- The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.
- Hiighlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.

## 3. Make it Easy

### Walk slowly but never backward
- The best is the enemy of the good
- Motion makes you feel you are getting things done, but really, you're just preparing to get something done.
- When preparation becomes a form of procastrination, you need to change something. You don't want to merely be planning, you want to be practicing.
- If you want to master a habit start with repetition, not perfection.
- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.
- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.

### The law of least effort
- Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.
- In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.
- What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle, that is the more difficult the habit, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.
- This is why it's crucial to make your habits so easy that you'll do them even when you don't feel like it.
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors and increase the friction associated with bad behaviors.
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

### The two minute rule
- Many habits occur at decisive moments, choices taht are like a fork in the road, and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
- When you start a new habit it should take less than two minutes to do.
- The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
- Standarize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist.

### How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible
- The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don't even have the option to act.


## 4. Make It Satisfying
### The cardinal rule of behavior change
- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.
- The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediatel punished is avoided.
- To make a good habit stick you need to make it immediately successful, even if it's in a small way.
- The first three laws increase the odds that a behavior will be performed the first time, the fourth law increases the odds that a behavor will be repeated next time.

### How to stick with good habits every day
- Tracking a habit gives you the satisfying feeling of making progress.
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit, like marking an X on a calendar.
- Don't break the chain, try to keep your habit streak alive.
- Never miss twice.

### Accountability partners
- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us.
- A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to anybehavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.

## Advanced tactics
- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.
- Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.
- Genes cannot be changed, they give you advantages in certain circumstances and disadvantages in other circumstances.
- Habits are easier when they align with your natural habilities.
- Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can't find a game like that, create it.
- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They tell us what to work hard on.

### How to stay motivated
- The goldilocks rule states that humas experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current habilities.
- The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredom
- As habits become routine, they become less interesting and satisfying. We get bored.
- Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going when work isn't exciting that makes the difference.
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
