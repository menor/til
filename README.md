## VIM

### Replacing surrounding character using vim-surround
If you have the [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) plugin installed:
- To replace surrounding symbols `cs"'` (will replace surrounding double quotes by single)
- To delete surrounding delimiters `ds(` (Will remove surrounding parentheses)


## Bash

### Globbing primitives
Some globbing primitives in bash are:
- `*`  matches everything
- `?`  matches any single character
- `[abd]`  matches any character from a, b or d
- `[a-d]`  matches any character from a, b, c or d

i.e.:
- `ls *1` will list all the files that end in `1`
- `ls file[0-9]` will list all the files that start with file and end with a character from 0 to 9

### Variable interpolation
The bash shell interpolates the variable if it's in double quotes, but not if it's in single quotes.
```sh
MYSTRING="a String"
MYSENTENCE="A sentence with $MYSTRING in it"

echo $ MYSENTENCE # A sentence with a String in it

MYSENTENCE='A sentence with $MYSTRING in it'
echo $ MYSENTENCE # A sentence with $MYSTRING in it
```

### Make variables readonly
To make a variable read only put `readonly` in front of it like this:
```sh
readonly MYVAR=astring
```

### Create several files in one go
It is possible to create several files with just one command by putting them between curly braces
`touch dir/{file1,file2,file3}` will create three files under dir

## Firefox

You can create different profiles to store separate history, bookmarks and add-ons, this is useful for keeping a separate work and life profile, so you don't think about live while working (or about work while living), also separate add-ons might come handy in case you want to test in a vanilla browser. To set this up in FIrefox got to `about:profiles`

## Homebrew
You can see which packages are outdated by running `brew outdated` and then upgrade them all using `brew upgrade`, you can also do this with casks by doing `brew cask outdated` and `brew cask upgrade`

## Postgres

### Debug postgres
I had the problem of postgres crashing with some weird error. To debug I did the following:
- Started postgres service through homebrew `brew services start postgresql`
- Ran `brew services list` to see to whic file the errors where logged
- Tailed the file (`tail -n 100 /usr/local/var/log/postgres.log`) and saw that the error was about the data being created by a previous version of postgres
(see stack overflow response [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47673746/2565132))

### Update postgres data
- To update data from previous postgres installations you can run `brew postgresql-upgrade-database` and the data will be migrated to the new version

## Productivity

### Theory of Constraints
The Theory of Constraints is a way to identify the most important limitng factor (the constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal. And systematically improve that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.
### Tips
- Setting a cadence for fixing bugs (i.e. biweekly) could help with improving the codebase
