## VIM

## Firefox

You can create different profiles to store separate history, bookmarks and add-ons, this is useful for keeping a separate work and life profile, so you don't think about live while working (or about work while living), also separate add-ons might come handy in case you want to test in a vanilla browser. To set this up in FIrefox got to `about:profiles`

## Homebrew
You can see which packages are outdated by running `brew outdated` and then upgrade them all using `brew upgrade`, you can also do this with casks by doing `brew cask outdated` and `brew cask upgrade`
